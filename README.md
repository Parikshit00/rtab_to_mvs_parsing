# rtab_to_mvs_parsing
This code is specifically designed for one purpose only,a simple parser code to parse the cam files generated by [RTAB-MAP](http://introlab.github.io/rtabmap/) into a format used by [the texrecon project](https://github.com/nmoehrle/mvs-texturing).  

If you are using kinect devices in a SLAM based approach to map environments in real time using RTABMAP this code is really helpful for texturing the mesh using images in a multi stereo view based approach using the images as done my the [texrecon project](http://www.gcc.tu-darmstadt.de/home/proj/texrecon/).
